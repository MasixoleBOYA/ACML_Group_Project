Dataset objectives

The main objective is to build a model using this dataset where the model will generate the next word based on a prompt of an initial word by the user. 
This will be done by predicting the probability distribution of the next word given a sequence of previous words.

1.	Preprocess the dataset to ensure it is in a format that can be used to train the model.
2.	Build a model and train the model using the training dataset.
3.	Use the validation dataset to avoid overfitting the model.
4.	Test the model using the test set.
5.	Evaluate the model.


Question 3
Describe the required pre-processing of the dataset and the split of data into train/validate/test

Pre-processing:

Standardising the text data:
•	Convert all characters to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
•	Convert contractions to their full forms.

Tokenisation:
•	Split the text into individual words.

Encode the text:
•	Convert the text into a numerical format that the model can understand. This will be done by converting the tokens into their corresponding numerical IDs.

Data split

Training set = 50%
Validating set = 25%
Test set = 25%

Question 4
Describe the choice of model and machine learning algorithm used. 
Describe the implementation of the model. Python libraries such as Keras and Pytorch are allowed.
