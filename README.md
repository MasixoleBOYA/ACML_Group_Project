# __Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning__
---

### PROJECT
#### our own referal reasource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEV_Jtmx2cc
The project for AC & ML requires you to analyse a dataset using machine learning techniques
and present your methods and results.
It is a group project. You should organise yourselves into groups of size 4 or less.
1) Source a dataset of sufficient complexity and interest.
See, e.g., UCI machine learning laboratory, or kaggle.com, but you are free to obtain datasets
from elsewhere, as long as no ethics clearance is required.
You must state clearly where the dataset was obtained from.
2) Describe the contents of the dataset and your objectives with respect to the dataset.
3) Describe the required preprocessing of the dataset and the split of data into train/validate/test.
4) Describe the choice of model and machine learning algorithm used. Describe the implementation of the model. Python libraries such as Keras and Pytorch are allowed. The model should
be sufficiently complex.
You may use CNN’s, RNN’s, autoencoders, GANS, or other complex architectures, if desired.
Please do not just use an existing model from the internet.
5) Describe any experiments that were done in finding a suitable model or fine-tuning the
model. Explain the choice of hyperparameters.
6) Present various graphs that were generated during the training of the model.
7) Present the results of the trained model on the test dataset, using both text and visuals,
and provide a short analysis of the results.
8) Put all the relevant information from the above into a report.


- `Required submission`: Your report and your code.

- `Due date for submission`: Monday 27 May, at 17h00.
